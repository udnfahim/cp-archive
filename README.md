# CP Archive

A repository for my Competitive Programming (CP) and problem-solving journey.  

I love solving algorithmic problems and practicing data structures through coding challenges. This repository contains solutions I have completed so far, including problems from platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, AtCoder, and others.  

> ⚠️ Some solutions are missing from the past, but I am working on keeping the repository updated with all problems I solve in the future.
